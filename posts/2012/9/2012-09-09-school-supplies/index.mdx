It’s a beautiful clear and cool Seattle evening and I’m listening to the [Swing Years](http://www.kuow.org/swing_years.php) on [KUOW](http://www.kuow.org/index.php) as I organize my art supplies. Tomorrow is orientation for the [Aristides Atelier](http://www.aristidesatelier.com/) at [Gage Academy](http://www.gageacademy.org/) where I hope to spend the next four years learning classical drawing and painting. The supply list arrived on August 1st and I’ve been accumulating an item here and an item there ever since. Tomorrow I will haul this rather massive pile across the 520 floating bridge and up to Capitol Hill where I will share a studio space with my fellow atelier students.
